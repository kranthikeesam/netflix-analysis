- How many Movies vs TV Shows are on Netflix?
- What are the most common genres?
- How has the number of titles changed over the years?
- Which countries contribute the most content?

## Skills Demonstrated

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Working with text data (genres, countries)
- Jupyter Notebook + Git & GitHub workflow
