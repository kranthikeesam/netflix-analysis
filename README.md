# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis – Where Data Meets Drama 🍿

## 📌 Overview
I took Netflix’s massive catalog of Movies and TV Shows and did what any data analyst would do…  
👉 **turned it into charts, insights, and a few existential questions about why there are 10,000 romantic comedies.**

This project explores *what Netflix is actually made of*:  
movies, TV shows, genres, countries, and how much content they’ve been throwing at us every year.

## 😂🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal was simple:  
**Take raw Netflix data, clean it, analyze it, visualize it, and make it tell a story — without falling asleep halfway through a Korean drama binge.**

Professionally speaking, this project demonstrates my ability to:
- Tame messy real-world data (no directors were harmed during cleaning)  
- Engineer meaningful features (hello `year_added` 👋)  
- Uncover insights using EDA  
- Build clean visualizations  
- Document and publish a polished project using GitHub  
- Look at 7,000 movie titles without losing my sanity

## ❓ Big Questions I Answered
### 1️⃣ Movies vs TV Shows  
Is Netflix becoming Hollywood or a TV network?

### 2️⃣ Genre Popularity  
Which genres dominate the platform?  
(And why are there so many “Crime Dramas”?)

### 3️⃣ Content Growth Over Time  
Is Netflix growing aggressively or chilling like its tagline?

### 4️⃣ Top Countries  
Which regions are producing the most content?

These help us understand Netflix’s content strategy without needing a meeting with their CEO.
